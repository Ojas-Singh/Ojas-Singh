Subject: Application for the post of "this position"

I am Ojas Singh, currently in the final semester of my BS-MS (computational chemistry) course at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali. I am writing to apply for the post of "this position".


 A strong background in theoretical and computational chemistry, photochemistry or chemical physics is desirable. Previous experience using quantum mechanical methods and atomistic simulations and proficiency in scientific programming are essential.
