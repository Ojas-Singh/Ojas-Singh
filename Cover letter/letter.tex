I am Ojas Singh, currently in the final semester of my BS-MS (chemistry) dual degree program
at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali. I am interested in the
project regarding quantum spectroscopy and exploring new states of matter out of equilibrium. I am writing this to express my sincere interest in joining your lab as a doctoral student this coming semester.

Presently, I am working on Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction for my master’s thesis at
my institute under the supervision of Dr. P. Balanarayan. Thus far, I have successfully
implemented an efficient CI algorithm with high-performance data structures in Rust, which is
the fastest implementation for our case. I am currently working on quantum dynamics using
the (t, t’) method.

As part of a summer project, I have previously developed a spectral clustering based fragmentation method for estimating the electronic energy of large molecules. The approach predicts the best possible fragments and overlaps heuristically, by utilizing the key features of graphs. The energy estimates showed excellent agreement with those obtained from actual computations of the complete molecules.

I look forward to employing theoretical and computational tools to aid first-principle computational modeling of light-matter interactions. I am interested in working with the principles of TDDFT and many-body methods as well as QED. I have perused your publication bridging quantum optics and electronic structure theory and found your research quite intriguing. Having this prior experience as well as an inquisitive mind and flexibility to explore new horizons, I am genuinely excited at the prospect of working under your supervision in this project and firmly believe that I would be a valuable asset to your team.

Thank you for your time and kind consideration. I would be highly obliged to hear from you.
